# Resources

## Literate Programming

* Knuth (1984) [Literate Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), 
    * Or you could read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) on literate programming, which is pretty good
* [Schulte et al (2012)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5f52/f0dc71c6ac47611599c31b2273e8b3b67eb5.pdf), Journal of Statistical Software, *sections 1 and 2 only*. This article describes an environment called Org-mode. We won't be using Org-mode, but this is a decent explanation of how to implement a literate software environment (esp. Fig 1, showing weaving and tangling)
* [Sweave manual](http://wiki.leg.ufpr.br/lib/exe/fetch.php/projetos:obesidade:sweave-rnews-2002-3.pdf)

## Markup Languages

* The [LaTeX Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a great practical guide to LaTeX.
* There are many LaTeX quickstart guides on the web. [This one](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/docs/latex.pdf) seems decent. The ['Not-So-Short Introduction'](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) is much more exhaustive, but Chapters 1 and 2 are a good overview.
* [tex.stackoverflow.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/): Stack Exchange's site about Tex and LaTeX.
* HTML intro?
* Daring Fireball markdown syntax. (Note that github uses a slightly different flavor - github markdown, explained here)

## Knitr, R Markdown and R Notebooks
* Yihui Xie's [knitr website](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
* The RStudio [R Markdown page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the [R Notebooks page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)
* RStudio's RMarkdown [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)





# Tasks

[Take your own data, or use one of the datasets I've provided. Create an R notebook (interactive .Rmd file) to analyze the data in some way. This should contain a brief introduction, and a Results/Discussion section, including a plot. Create an .html output (which creates, as an intermediary, an .md file). Post **both** the .Rmd file, and the resulting .md file, to github. Note that you will also need to include the image files that go with teh markdown file. ]

For those who need data: there's a pretty good list of open data sources [here](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-free-big-data-sources-everyone-should-know). I particularly like the [CIA World Factbook Country Comparisons](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/rankorderguide.html), which has lots of downloadable .txt-format data.
